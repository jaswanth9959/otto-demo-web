              any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the

            Parsley AI may suspend Customer's access to the Parsley AI
            Application and related services due to a Suspension Event, but
            where practicable will give Customer prior notice so that Customer

            not required to give prior notice in exigent circumstances or for a
            suspension made to avoid material harm or violation of Law. Once the
            Suspension Event is resolved, Parsley AI will promptly restore
            Customer's access to the Parsley AI Application in accordance with
            this Agreement. &quot;<strong>Suspension Event</strong>&quot; means
            (a) Customer's account is 30 days or more overdue, (b) Customer is
            in breach of the <strong>Usage Rules</strong> section of this
            Agreement or (c) Customer's use of the Parsley AI Application risks
            material harm to the Parsley AI Application or others.

              <strong class="underline">Interpretation.</strong> In this

              one and the same agreement.

              Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to
              this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be negotiated
              informally prior to arbitration or a lawsuit. If the parties

              by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its
              commercial, or other arbitration rules. Judgment on the award

              Waivers must be signed by the waiving party's authorized

              provision of this Agreement is held unenforceable, it will be

            <li>
              <strong class="underline">Force Majeure.</strong> Neither party is
              liable for a delay or failure to perform this Agreement due to an
              unforeseen event beyond a party's reasonable control, such as a
              strike, blockade, war, pandemic, act of terrorism, riot,
              third-party Internet or utility failure, refusal of government
              license or natural disaster, where the affected party takes
              reasonable and customary measures to avoid or mitigate such
              event's effects. If any such event materially adversely affects
              the Parsley AI Application for 15 or more consecutive days, either
              party may terminate the affected Order Form(s) upon notice to the
              other and Parsley AI will refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused
              fees for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term. However,
              this Section does not limit Customer's obligations to pay fees
              owed.

              <strong class="underline">Subcontractors.</strong> Parsley AI may
              use subcontractors and permit them to exercise its rights and
              fulfill its obligations, but Parsley AI remains responsible for
              their compliance with this Agreement and for Parsley AI's overall
              performance under this Agreement.
